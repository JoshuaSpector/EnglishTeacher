"If you cannot understand my argument, and declare "It's Greek to me", you are quoting
Shakespeare; if you claim to be more sinned against than sinning, you are quoting
Shakespeare; if you recall your salad days, you are quoting Shakespeare; if you act more
in sorrow than in anger, if your wish is father to the thought, if your lost
property has vanished into thin air, you are quoting Shakespeare; if you have ever refused
to budge an inch or suffered from green-eyed jealousy, if you have played fast and loose,
if you have been tongue-tied, a tower of strength, hoodwinked or in a pickle, if you
have knitted your brows, made a virtue of necessity, insisted on fair play, slept not one
wink, stood on ceremony, danced attendance (on your lord and master), laughed
yourself into stitches, had short shrift, cold comfort or too much of a good thing, if you
have seen better days or lived in a fool's paradise - why, be that as it may, the more fool
you, for it is a foregone conclusion that you are (as good luck would have it) quoting
Shakespeare; if you think it is early days and clear out bag and baggage, if you think it
is high time and that that is the long and short of it, if you believe that the game is up and
that truth will out even if it involves your own flesh and blood, if you lie low till the crack of
doom because you suspect foul play, if you have your teeth set on edge (at one fell
swoop) without rhyme or reason, then - to give the devil his due - if the truth were
known (for surely you have a tongue in your head) you are quoting Shakespeare; even if
you bid me good riddance and send me packing, if you wish I were dead as a door-nail, if
you think I am an eyesore, a laughing stock, the devil incarnate, a stony-hearted
villain, bloody-minded or a blinking idiot, then - by Jove! O Lord!
Tut, tut! for goodness' sake! what the dickens! but me no buts -
it is all one to me, for you are quoting Shakespeare."
